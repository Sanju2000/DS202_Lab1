# Partner (Ben's) Information 
- Name: Benjamin Litterer 
- Github: blitt2018
- The message from the last commit says "add files via upload". It looks like she added the owner_ files most recently.  The id for the commit is d6f96ac8a52560df981d4c50b056726f59aa89a2
- I was successfully able to open the owner_.Rmd file
- For me, I think it is important to become comfortable creating, deleting, and navigating files/directories before using git.
